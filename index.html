            A Private Pilot License (PPL) is the most sought after type of pilot
            certification. In the United States, a Private Pilot License is
            actually called a Private Pilot Certificate and is similar to what a
            driver's license is for automobiles.

          <li class="questions" id="q2">Why should I get a PPL</li>
          <p class="answers" id="ans2">
            By earning a private pilot license, you can legally fly an aircraft.
            Private pilots are trained to navigate small aircraft by themselves.
            Flight training includes aircraft maneuvers, navigation, emergency
            procedures and cross-country flight planning
          </p>

          <p class="answers" id="ans3">
            A licensed pilot may partake in activities ranging from flying to a
            nearby airport for lunch, to traveling across the country or even
            around the world without ever stepping foot on an airliner. A
            private pilot can take friends and family for rides, practice
            maneuvers, or become involved in many of the wonderful programs that
            introduce people to flying
